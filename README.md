## About Me

I am Shivani Guniganti and I am from Telangana, India. I completed by undergraduation i.e., Bachelors of commerce in computer science in 2022 from loyola Academy, Hyderabad, India.

## Favorite Activities

One of my most favourite activity is to cook. I can cook various cuisines i.e., chinese, indian, japanese and many more. But atlast, I am a pro at cooking Indian dishes like dal, various south indian curries and etc.

## Favorite Sport

One of my most favourite sport is Badmintion. I love badminton because it’s an indoor sport so you can play it regardless of the weather. Also, the entry-level is low, so you can bring friends that have never played it, and you will get a fun time from it. Socializing with friends is great in badminton. Also, it’s a good workout and cheap!


## Favorite Music

I prefer instrumental hymns better than lyrics because they are more relaxing and I love instrument sounds, especially the violin.By the time Sunday is over though I am more than ready to listen to my usual stuff. I feel like I listen to music all the time, 24/7, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

## Lessons Learned and Confusions

You can stand up for yourself and take everything that life throws at you. You’ll always figure things out even if it seems like an impossible challenge. As time passes, you’ll learn that you are stronger than you think and you can face your challenges confidently.
